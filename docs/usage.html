CAL-JLC, version: V0.8 (beta)
feedback: contact.caljlc@gmail.com

Provides 2-way control between audio mixers supporting the CSCP protocol and JL-Cooper control panels over Ethernet.

Tested with Calrec Brio & Impulse, and JL-Cooper Eclipse MXL2.

The default configuration for the JL-Cooper panel is address 192.168.200.114 on port 49300.
JL-Cooper configuration can be changed by accessing its setup UI using a web-browser on its address.
To set the JL-Cooper panel back to its default configuration, press and hold the 3 white buttons in fader strip 8 while powering up the unit.
... The unit will indicate when it has reset and prompt to repower for the changes to be applied.


This version provides 2-way control of faders and cut/on buttons, along with fader labels.
Note, writing data to the LCDs on the JLC panel is slow, so this version currently only updates labels when the application starts up.


Usage:

Unzip the CAL-JLC_08.zip file to a location of your choice, keeping all of the file contents together.

Double-click the CAL-JLC_08.exe file to launch the application. 

On first usage, you will be prompted for connection details. 

If the JLC panel is using its default settings, its address is 192.168.200.114, and port 49300.

Check your mixer UI to setup/view its CSCP address and port, ensuring CSCP is enabled.

Enter "y" at the prompt for two-way fader control, o "n" for one-way JLC->CAL

Choose any faders from 1 to 192 on the mixer to map to the 8 faders on the JLC panel.

Note, mixer CSCP faders "wrap" so you can control different layers / do not have to control the visible/top layer, 

... e.g. on a mixer with 32 physical faders, CSCP fader 33 = Layer 1 B fader 1, CSCP fader 65 = Layer 2 A fader 1 etc.).


Ensure the machine this appication is running on has IP address/es that are reachable by the addresses set on both the mixer and the JLC.
