	<h4>Download, unzip, and run</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/caljlc/CAL-JLC/releases/download/V0.8/CAL-JLC_08.zip">Download</a> the CAL-JLC application from this site.</li>
		
		<li>Unzip the downloaded CAL-JLC_08.zip file to a location of your choice, keeping all of the file contents together.</li>
		
		<li>Double-click the CAL-JLC_08.exe file to launch the application.</li>	
	</ul>

	<p>On first use, you will be prompted to enter some connection and configuration information.</p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>If the JLC panel is using its default settings, its address is 192.168.200.114, using port 49300.</li>
		
		<li>Check your mixer's UI to setup/view its CSCP address and port, ensuring CSCP is enabled.</li>
		
		<li>Enter "y" at the prompt for two-way fader control, o "n" for one-way JLC->CAL</li>
		
		<li>Choose any faders from 1 to 192 on the mixer to map to the 8 faders on the JLC panel.

			Note, mixer CSCP faders "wrap" so you can control different layers / do not have to control the visible/top layer, 

			... e.g. on a mixer with 32 physical faders, CSCP fader 33 = Layer 1 B fader 1, CSCP fader 65 = Layer 2 A fader 1 etc.).
		</li>
		
		<li>Ensure the machine this appication is running on has IP address/es that are reachable by the addresses set on both the mixer and the JLC.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Current: CAL-JLC, version: V0.8 (beta evaulation). Tested with JL-Cooper Eclipse MXL2.</p>

	<p>
		JL-Cooper panel configuration can be changed by accessing its setup UI using a web-browser on its address.
		To set the JL-Cooper panel back to its default address (192.168.200.114) and configuration, press and hold the 3 white buttons in fader strip 8 
		while powering up the unit... The unit will indicate when it has reset and will prompt to repower for the changes to be applied.
	</p>
	
	2-way fader control and cut/on button switching between audio mixers supporting the CSCP protocol and JL-Cooper control panels over Ethernet.
	
	<p>
		This version provides 2-way control of faders and cut/on buttons, along with fader labels.
		Note, writing data to the LCDs on the JLC panel is slow, so this version currently only updates labels when the application starts up.
